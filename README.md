### Motivation
#### My last two jobs required skills to manipulate a large amount of data in order to generate a report or even create dashboard to driven the main decisions.  
#### The results that I reached showed me the power of data-driven decision and make me look up to Data Science with another eyes. 
#### Now my newest goal is be a Data Scientist, thus I decided to start this journey taking a Data Scientist Nano Degree offered by Udacity.
#### Therefore, this repository will contain all teh projects that I will develop into this course.
