### Motivation

My last two jobs required skills to manipulate a large amount of data to generate a report or even create a dashboard to driven the main decisions. The results that I reached showed me the power of data-driven decision and made me look up to Data Science with other eyes. Now, my newest goal is to be a Data Scientist. Thus, I decided to start this journey taking a Data Scientist Nano Degree offered by Udacity.  
**Therefore, this repository will contain all the projects that I will develop into this course.**
