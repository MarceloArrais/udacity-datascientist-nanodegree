Rio de Janeiro is the city owner of Christ the Redeemer, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. But not just that, this city has so many attractions that it is almost impossible to know all of them in an week or even in a month. There you can do whatever you want from hiking in an amazing forest trail to enjoyin clubbing at night. No wonder, brazilians call her wonderful city!!!

### **(a) How Airbnb is growing in Rio de Janeiro?**

Since 2015, the Airbnb is growing in Rio de Janeiro as we can see in the chart above which show us that in 2015 this startup reached a total of 20 thousand reviews and four years later this number has increased almost in 6 times. Another fact is that the straight of the line is increasing over the years indicating a raising of rate of number of reviews. Nevertheless, i n the first quater of 2020, the Airbnb was following this tendency stronger than last year, but it has been strucked by COVID-19 after carnival (9th week): when the first register of people contamined by this virus occured.

### ***(b) How events can boost Airbnb activities?***   

It is pretty nice to see how the number of reviews per week throughout the years happens in Rio de Janeiro and notice that some events affects a lot the tourism in the city. For example, it is notable the peaks of New Year's Eve (annually), Carnival (annually), Olimpics Games (2016), Rock in Rio (2017, 2019) and America Cup of football (2019). In another hand, the numbers os reviews is descreasing since 9th week of 2020 and it shows how strong is being the impact of coronavirus at the Airbnb growth.

I've mentioned before that the events impact a lot the market of Airbnb in Rio de Janeiro and to make it clear I built the table below that represent the percentage increase of reviews comparing each peak with average of respective year. Thereby, it evident that the most impactant event was the Olimpcs Games that occured in 2016 and reached the impressive mark of 355,94% and the less impactant event was American Cup of Football with 22,90%.

***(e) What are the average price por accommodates stratified by neighborhood and by property type?***

Using the 10 most pospular neighborhood and 5 most required property type, it is possible to see that the both neighborhood and property type influence the avarege price per accommodate. Let's go to compare the difference perfil of price among Flamengo and Leblon neighborhoods. A house in Flamengo is much more cheaper than Leblon, but Serviced apartament is more expensive in Flamengo than in Leblon. Is this chart, we can see that Leblon is the neighborhood which present the most expensive average price divided by property type.
